Issue Summary:

Duration:
Start Time: January 15, 2023, 02:00 PM (UTC)
End Time: January 15, 2023, 04:30 PM (UTC)

Impact:
The outage affected our main authentication service, rendering users unable to log in. Approximately 30% of users experienced disruptions, leading to frustration and a temporary halt in service accessibility.

Root Cause:
The root cause was identified as a misconfigured load balancer that resulted in an overload on the authentication server, causing it to reject incoming requests.

Timeline:

Detection Time: January 15, 2023, 02:15 PM (UTC)

Detection Method: Monitoring alert triggered due to a spike in authentication failures.

Actions Taken:

Investigation: Examined server logs to identify patterns and assess the impact.
Assumption: Initially suspected a DDoS attack due to the sudden increase in authentication failures.
Misleading Paths:

Focus on DDoS: Devoted significant time investigating DDoS possibilities, although subsequent analysis revealed no evidence of an attack.
Escalation:

First Level: Alert escalated to the DevOps team.
Second Level: Escalated to the Security team to investigate potential security threats.
Resolution:

Identified Cause: Discovered misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, causing an uneven distribution of traffic.
Fix Implemented: Adjusted load balancer configuration to evenly distribute traffic and prevent overloading.
Root Cause and Resolution:

Cause Analysis:

The load balancer misconfiguration led to a skewed distribution of requests, with a single server handling the majority of authentication attempts.
This resulted in an overload on the server, triggering authentication failures and service disruptions.
Resolution Steps:

Load Balancer Configuration: Updated load balancer settings to ensure a balanced distribution of incoming requests across all authentication servers.
Monitoring Enhancement: Implemented additional monitoring to quickly identify and respond to similar load-related issues.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improvements/Fixes:

Automated Configuration Checks: Implement automated checks for load balancer configurations to detect and prevent misconfigurations.
Load Testing: Conduct regular load testing to simulate peak traffic and identify potential performance bottlenecks.
Enhanced Logging: Improve logging to provide more detailed information during troubleshooting.
Tasks:

Update SOP: Revise Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to include specific steps for load balancer configuration checks and troubleshooting.
Training: Conduct training sessions for the operations team on identifying and responding to load-related issues promptly.
Communication Plan: Develop a communication plan for informing users during service disruptions, minimizing frustration.
In conclusion, the outage was a result of a misconfigured load balancer, causing disruptions to the authentication service. The incident highlighted the importance of continuous monitoring, quick detection, and well-defined escalation procedures to resolve issues promptly. The implemented corrective measures aim to prevent similar incidents in the future, ensuring a more robust and reliable authentication service for our users.
